### 🔥 Important  
Currently building a neural network from scratch using Python — implementing everything from forward propagation to loss calculation without high-level frameworks. Gaining a deep understanding of how models really work under the hood.

### 📝 Note  
This project is part of my self-study into machine learning fundamentals. I'm modularizing each part (layers, activations, loss functions) and visualizing performance — updates and code coming soon! 🧠📊

### 💡 Tip  
Curious how neural nets actually learn? I’m demystifying them one function at a time. Stay tuned for my implementation walkthrough — or follow me on X (Twitter) to follow along.
